# F3: The Open-Source Data File Format for the Future

F3 is a data file format that is designed with efficiency, interoperability, and extensibility in mind. It provides a data organization that rectifies the layout shortcomings of the last-generation formats like Parquet, while at the same time maintaining good interoperability and extensibility (a.k.a future-proof) via embedded Wasm decoders.

> ⚠️ This project is a research prototype verifying the ideas in the paper. You should not use it in production.

## Build instructions

We primarily tested on Debian 12, but you can set up macOS hosts with the steps below.

### Debian 12

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/setup_debian.sh
# build the PoC package of F3
cargo build -p fff-poc
# run unit test for F3
cargo test -p fff-poc
```

### macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/setup_macos.sh
cargo build -p fff-poc
cargo test -p fff-poc
```

```

The tree above highlights the crates and directories you will touch most often when extending the file format or when building new experiments.

## Usage

1. **Environment setup**  
   Clone the repo, pull submodules, and run the platform-specific setup script (`scripts/setup_debian.sh` or `scripts/setup_macos.sh`). These scripts install Rust, emsdk, Binaryen, and the compiler toolchain needed for the Wasm components.

2. **Build & test**  
   Build the PoC crate and run its full test suite (including integration tests and doctests):
   ```shell
   cargo build -p fff-poc
   cargo test  -p fff-poc
   ```
   The long-running `e2e` tests perform multi-row-group validation; expect them to take ~2–3 minutes on a laptop.

3. **Run experiments or benchmarks**  
   The `fff-bench` crate exposes several Clap-powered binaries under `fff-bench/examples`. For example, you can compute compressed sizes for all bundled benchmark datasets or measure scan time against a particular format:
   ```shell
   # Print the available subcommands
   cargo run -p fff-bench --example bench -- --help

   # Re-encode benchmark datasets into every supported format
   cargo run -p fff-bench --example bench -- compressed-size

   # Compare scan latency for a given format (e.g., parquet, lance, fff)
   cargo run -p fff-bench --example bench -- scan-time --format fff
   ```
   Some commands expect local copies of the datasets referenced in `fff-bench::bench_data`; see `fff-bench/examples/README.md` and `doc/paper_reproduction.md` for dataset download instructions.

4. **Debug & develop**  
   - Modify encoding logic in `fff-encoding/` or Wasm adapters under `fff-ude-wasm/wasm/*.rs`, then rerun the `fff-poc` tests.
   - Use `cargo test -p fff-bench -- --ignored` to exercise benchmarks marked as ignored by default.
   - The helper scripts in `scripts/` and `exp_scripts/` automate collecting statistics for the paper; inspect them when reproducing published figures.
   - Embed additional ANN/vector indexes via `vector_index::VectorIndexConfig` and inspect them at read time with `FileReaderV2::vector_indexes()`.
   - Run brute-force vector recall experiments by serializing blobs with `vector_index::encode_bruteforce_index` and querying them through `FileReaderV2::vector_knn_l2`.

## Important directories

[format](format): FlatBuffer definition of the file format.

[fff-poc](fff-poc): The main code of the F3 format. It references other subdirs like fff-core, fff-encoding, fff-format, and fff-ude-wasm.

[fff-bench](fff-bench): Benchmarks and experiments appeared in the paper. Specifically, [fff-bench/examples](fff-bench/examples) should contain most experiments, both micro and e2e.

fff-ude*: ude stand for User-Defined-Encoding and code in those directories relates to the Wasm decoding implementation.

[scripts](scripts) and [exp_scripts](exp_scripts): scripts related to run the experiments.

abstract = {Columnar storage formats are the foundation for modern data analytics systems. The proliferation of open-source file formats (i.e., Parquet, ORC) allows seamless data sharing across disparate platforms. However, these formats were created over a decade ago for hardware and workload environments that are much different from today. Although these formats have incorporated some updates to their specification to adapt to these changes, not all deployments support those modifications, and too often systems cannot overcome the formats' deficiencies and limitations without a rewrite.In this paper, we present the Future-proof File Format (F3) project. It is a next-generation open-source file format with interoperability, extensibility, and efficiency as its core design principles. F3 obviates the need to create a new format every time a shift occurs in data processing and computing by providing a data organization structure and a general-purpose API to allow developers to add new encoding schemes easily. Each self-describing F3 file includes both the data and meta-data, as well as WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries to decode the data. Embedding the decoders in each file requires minimal storage (kilobytes) and ensures compatibility on any platform in case native decoders are unavailable. To evaluate F3, we compared it against legacy and state-of-the-art open-source file formats. Our evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of F3's storage layout and the benefits of Wasm-driven decoding.},
